/*
 * Before we start, below is the list of classes/objects used in the adapter pattern:

Target — This defines the domain-specific interface that the client uses. This is the Shape interface in our example.
Adapter — This adapts the interface from the adaptee to the target interface. I will point the adapter classes based on the different approach below.
Adaptee — This defines an existing interface that needs adapting. This is the GeometricShape interface in our example.
Client — This collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface. The Drawing class is the client in our example.
